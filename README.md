</p>

1. A user submits a support request
2. The ticket is reviewed and prioritized
3. A support technician begins troubleshooting
4. If unresolved, the ticket is escalated or waits for user response
5. Once fixed, the ticket is marked as resolved and closed

This demonstrates a full ticket handling process from start to finish.
